# In this project we present the use of Spring Boot JPA, Spring Web and Spring Dev Tools for the boat reservation system application deployment.

We follow the respective steps as listed below:

1. Creation of entities for the ORM with the boat and category tables.
2. Creation of Interfaces and repositories for CRUD implementation with boat and category tables.
3. Coding of Controllers to expose the services of **Boat** and **Category**.

Up to this part the following endpoints were successfully tested with Postman: 
* /Boat/all
* /Boat/save
* /Category/all
* /Category/save
